# How to throw exceptions

Exceptions thrown on the code follow the idea of a `ThrowHelper` pattern due to the benefits explained in [Parameter Null Checking in C# 11 and the ThrowHelper pattern](https://dunnhq.com/posts/2022/throw-helper/).

This pattern to optimize the IL generated by throwing exceptions is used throughout on the dotnet runtime repo. See:

- [CoreLib ThrowHelper.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/ThrowHelper.cs): see explanation on the header of the source file for more details on why this pattern is used.
- [ArgumentNullException](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/9e81ca53137c587bce0f30bf60f13bb10fbdd204/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/ArgumentNullException.cs#L63).
- [ArgumentException](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/9e81ca53137c587bce0f30bf60f13bb10fbdd204/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/ArgumentException.cs#L110).
- [System.Memory ThrowHelper](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/953f52482ac2460e4b3faff33e4f73c9b30cd7b4/src/libraries/System.Memory/src/System/ThrowHelper.cs): see explanation on the header of the source file for more details on why this pattern is used.

In short:

> Having a throw new in your methods can be inefficient. The inefficiency comes from the fact that a fair amount of assembly code is
generated to throw the exception."
>
> "... there is a pattern that can help both eliminate the extra assembly code instructions, and optimize the code so that registers
are not set-up needlessly."

Sometimes I don't implement the full `ThrowHelper` pattern because I want to throw the exception from a `switch case`. If I had the `ThrowHelper` throw the exception the `switch case` doesn't know that and I still need to return something after.

>**Note**

> The `[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]` attribute for the `Create<Exception>` method is what avoids the extra exception setup assembly
instructions from being populated on the call sites that use this method. This attribute doesn't seem to be required when the method only contains a `throw` statement as you can see on the [ArgumentNullException](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/9e81ca53137c587bce0f30bf60f13bb10fbdd204/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/ArgumentNullException.cs#L63) and [ArgumentException](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/9e81ca53137c587bce0f30bf60f13bb10fbdd204/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/ArgumentException.cs#L110).
